RFM Analysis Project
This project performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on a dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and segmentation. It uses SQL queries to analyze sales data and derive meaningful information.

The RFM analysis is a technique used in marketing and customer relationship management to segment customers based on their transactional data. It focuses on three key dimensions:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase
Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases
Monetary Value: The total monetary value of a customer's purchases
By analyzing these dimensions, we can classify customers into different segments, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing and retention strategies accordingly.

This project provides several SQL queries that perform RFM analysis on a given dataset. Each query focuses on different aspects, such as identifying the highest revenue-generating year and month, best-selling products, customer segmentation, and more.
